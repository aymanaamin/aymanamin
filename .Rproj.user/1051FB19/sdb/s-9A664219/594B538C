Assuming the model errors are normally distributed and using two priors, i.e. natural conjugate and Jeffreysâ€™ priors, on the model parameters, we derive the joint posterior mass function of the model order in a closed-form. Accordingly, the posterior mass function can be investigated and the best order of DSAR model is chosen as a value with the highest posterior probability for the time series being analyzed.\"\n\nauthors = [\"Ayman A.

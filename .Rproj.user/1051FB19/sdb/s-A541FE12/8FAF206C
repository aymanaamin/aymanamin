Before that, I worked as A Tutor for Statistics and Mathematics from February 2012 to June 2014 at <a href = \"http://www.swin.edu.au/\">Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia</a>. Moreover, I worked as A Teaching Assistant for Statistics and Mathematics from May 2007 to April 2010 at <a href = \"http://www.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en\">Faculty of Commerce, Menoufia University, Egypt</a>. I was awarded my PhD degree from <a href = \"http://www.swin.edu.au/\">Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia</a> (in January 2014). I received my MSC in Statistics (with excellent degree in October 2009) and BSC in Statistics and Social Science Computing (with excellent degree in June 2006) from <a href = \"http://www.feps.eun.eg/\">Faculty of Economic and Political Science (FEPS), Cairo University</a>, Egypt.\n\nMy research work is mainly in time series analysis and forecasting methods. In my *Master study*, I  proposed a Bayesian inference for multiplicative seasonal ARMA models by implementing MCMC Gibbs sampling algorithm. In addition in my *PhD study*, I continued my work in time series analysis but mostly in the real application of time series forecasting. In particular, I was working on proposing an automated statistical approach to forecasting Quality attributes of software systems. These Quality attributes include performance, reliability, and availability. This forecasting approach is mainly based on linear and non-linear time series models and wavelet analysis. Currently, I am mainly working on modeling *multiple seasonality* aiming to propose a new efficient forecasting method that can be effectively applied to different research fields such as finance, economics and software engineering.\n\n",

Existing approaches trigger adaptations after detecting violations in quality of service (QoS) requirements by just comparing observed QoS values to predefined thresholds without any statistical confidence or certainty. These threshold-based adaptation approaches may perform unnecessary adaptations, which can lead to severe shortcomings such as follow-up failures or increased costs. In this paper we introduce a statistical approach based on CUSUM control charts called AuDeQAV - Automated Detection of QoS Attributes Violations. This approach estimates at runtime a current status of the running system, and monitors its QoS attributes and provides early detection of violations in its requirements with a defined level of confidence. This enables timely intervention preventing undesired consequences from the violation or from inappropriate remediation. We validated our approach using a series of experiments and response time datasets from real-world web services.\"\n\nauthors = [\"Ayman A.

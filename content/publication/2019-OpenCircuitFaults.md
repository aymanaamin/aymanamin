abstract = "In this paper, we introduce a real-time fault detection technique based on statistical EWMA control charts for detecting power switch open circuit faults in inverter feeding induction motor drives. The proposed algorithm is able to detect simultaneously double and triple switches open circuit faults, besides single open circuit faults. The proposed technique is suitable for open/closed loop control systems and sensor/sensorless control configurations. We conduct several Digital Signal Processor-based experimental works to evaluate the accuracy of the introduced detection technique concerning different operating conditions. The results provide evidence of the effectiveness and fast detection with no false alarms of the proposed technique."
